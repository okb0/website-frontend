<h1>Contact Page</h1>
<p>So you want to contact me? Interesting... I wonder why. Do you hate the CSS of this website that much? Don't worry, so do I. My talents do not lie in UI design... 
    If you have any suggestions on how to improve this site, whether it is lay-out suggestions or functionalities, feel free to reach out to me. 
    If you want a response, leave behind your e-mail address too. If I end up implementing your idea, I will add you to my credits page :), so make
    sure to leave your desired username/portfoliolink that people can find you by.
