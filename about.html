<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>Hi! I'm a 25-year old student master's student at the University of Leiden, studying Computer Science: Artificial Intelligence. 
    I like coming up with impossible ideas, and then making them reality, either on my own or with friends. Portfolio coming soon.
</p>

<h1>Why did I make this?</h1>
<p>Once upon a second semester, I decided to take 7 courses, even though the recommended amount was 5. Why you may ask? Because they were all too
    interesting, and I didn't want to choose. However, so many of them required me to read research papers, and I also enjoy having a life. So one day,
    while in the shower, I thought to myself: wouldn't it be useful to be able to listen to a research paper right about now? And tada, now I can.
    And so can you. :)
